    The Capacity and Availability Management process area involves establishing and maintaining capacity and availability&#xD;
    at a justifiable cost and with an efficient use of resources. Capacity and availability management activities can be&#xD;
    performed at different levels of the organization, including across different services.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Capacity and Availability Management process area involves the following activities:&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Establishing and maintaining a capacity and availability management strategy&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Providing and allocating resources appropriately&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Monitoring, analyzing, understanding, and reporting on current and future demand for services, use of resources,&#xD;
        capacity, service system performance, and service availability&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Determining corrective actions to ensure appropriate capacity and availability while balancing costs against&#xD;
        resources needed and supply against demand&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    “Capacity” is the degree to which one thing can support, hold, process, or produce another thing. In the context of&#xD;
    services, capacity can refer to the maximum amount of service delivery or maximum number of service requests that a&#xD;
    service system can handle successfully within a fixed period of time. Capacity is a quality attribute. The definition&#xD;
    and measurement of capacity can differ for different types of services and service systems and can be defined in the&#xD;
    service agreement. In addition, capacity definitions and measures can be derived from service agreements, rather than&#xD;
    reflected there. If the service agreement has no explicit capacity requirements, it may still imply derived capacity&#xD;
    requirements for the service or service system. For some services, capacity can be the maximum size, volume, or&#xD;
    throughput of service system components.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As part of establishing the capacity and availability management strategy, the following are determined:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Resources appropriate to manage&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Aspects of the service system that affect service availability and should be measured, monitored, analyzed, and&#xD;
        managed&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    “Availability” is the degree to which something is accessible and usable when needed. In the context of services,&#xD;
    availability can refer to the set of times, places, and other circumstances in which services are to be delivered,&#xD;
    service requests are to be honored, or other aspects of a service agreement are to be valid. Availability is a quality&#xD;
    attribute. Different work groups can have different definitions and measurements of availability for different types of&#xD;
    services and service systems and for various perspectives of availability (e.g., business perspective, end-user&#xD;
    perspective, customer perspective, service provider perspective). The definition of availability requires an&#xD;
    understanding of how service system components support service requirements for availability, which can be defined in&#xD;
    the service agreement. In addition, availability requirements and measures can both depend on and affect other closely&#xD;
    related quality attribute requirements, such as maintainability, reliability, sustainability, and security.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Availability is one of the most visible indicators of service quality in the eyes of the end user and customer. For&#xD;
    some services, understanding the Capacity and Availability Management (CAM) 127&lt;br />&#xD;
    relationships among attributes such as reliability and maintainability and availability is important to managing&#xD;
    availability.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    “Capacity management” is focused on how best to provide resources to meet service requirements. “Availability&#xD;
    management” is focused on delivering a sustained level of availability to meet service requirements. However, at a high&#xD;
    level, many of the best practices for capacity management and availability management are similar enough to be&#xD;
    combined, and they become closely coupled. Capacity management provides the means for achieving sustained availability&#xD;
    to meet service requirements. (For some services, it provides spare capacity and resilience as well.)&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The simultaneous production and consumption of services is one of the unique characteristics of services. This&#xD;
    characteristic presents some challenges for managing the capacity and availability of services. If the capacity and&#xD;
    availability to provide the service is not present when demand occurs, the customer must wait, resulting in costs of&#xD;
    one kind or another (e.g., lower customer satisfaction, lost business as customers give up on waiting, financial&#xD;
    penalties). Costs can also be associated with excess capacity when estimated demand does not occur (e.g., cost of staff&#xD;
    on the payroll sitting idle, purchasing costs of excess capacity).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Capacity and availability management includes establishing service system representations and using these&#xD;
    representations for the following:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Supporting negotiation of appropriate service agreements&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Planning&amp;nbsp; Making decisions&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Considering corrective actions&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Providing and allocating resources to meet current and future service requirements&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    “Service system representations,” such as models, simulations, diagrams, maps, and prototypes, provide insight into how&#xD;
    a service system will behave given specific work volumes and varieties. These representations can be built using&#xD;
    spreadsheets, commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) tools (e.g., simulation packages), or tools developed in house. For some&#xD;
    services, the representations can be known as historical baselines, trend analyses, analytical models, analysis of&#xD;
    waiting times in queues, simulation models, statistical models (e.g., regression models, time series models), causal&#xD;
    models (e.g., probabilistic networks), or application sizing.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The scope of capacity and availability management can be one service system or multiple service systems. If the service&#xD;
    provider is operating multiple service systems, capacity and availability management processes can be performed&#xD;
    independently on each discrete service system but the organization may realize reduced value.&#xD;
