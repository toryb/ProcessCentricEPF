    Causal analysis and resolution improves quality and productivity by preventing the introduction of defects or problems&#xD;
    and by identifying and appropriately incorporating the causes of superior process performance.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Causal Analysis and Resolution process area involves the following activities:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Identifying and analyzing causes of selected outcomes. The selected outcomes can represent defects and problems&#xD;
        that can be prevented from happening in the future or successes that can be implemented in work groups or the&#xD;
        organization.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Taking actions to complete the following: &#xD;
        &lt;ul>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Remove causes and prevent the recurrence of those types of defects and problems in the future&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Proactively analyze data to identify potential problems and prevent them from occurring&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Incorporate the causes of successes into the process to improve future process performance&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;/ul>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Reliance on detecting defects and problems after they have been introduced is not cost effective. It is more effective&#xD;
    to prevent defects and problems by integrating Causal Analysis and Resolution activities into each phase of the work&#xD;
    lifecycle.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Since similar outcomes may have been previously encountered in other work or in earlier phases or tasks of the current&#xD;
    work activity, Causal Analysis and Resolution activities are mechanisms for communicating lessons learned among work&#xD;
    groups.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Types of outcomes encountered are analyzed to identify trends. Based on an understanding of the defined process and how&#xD;
    it is implemented, root causes of these outcomes and future implications of them are determined.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Since it is impractical to perform causal analysis on all outcomes, targets are selected by tradeoffs on estimated&#xD;
    investments and estimated returns of quality, productivity, and cycle time.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Measurement and analysis processes should already be in place. Existing defined measures can be used, though in some&#xD;
    instances new&amp;nbsp;measurement definitions, redefinitions, or clarified definitions may be needed to analyze the&#xD;
    effects of a process change.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;em>Refer to the Measurement and Analysis process area for more information about aligning measurement and analysis&#xD;
    activities and providing measurement results.&lt;/em>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Causal Analysis and Resolution activities provide a mechanism for work groups to evaluate their processes at the local&#xD;
    level and look for improvements that can be implemented.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    When improvements are judged to be effective, the information is submitted to the organizational level for potential&#xD;
    deployment in the organizational processes.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The specific practices of this process area apply to a process that is selected for quantitative management. Use of the&#xD;
    specific practices of this process area can add value in other situations, but the results may not provide the same&#xD;
    degree of impact to the organizationâ€™s quality and process performance objectives.&#xD;
