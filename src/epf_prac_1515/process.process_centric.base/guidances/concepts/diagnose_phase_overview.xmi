    &lt;span style=&quot;FONT-SIZE: 9pt&quot;>The Diagnose process is designed to help the client determine the right solution to meet&#xD;
    their needs.&lt;/span>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;span style=&quot;FONT-SIZE: 9pt&quot;>The Diagnose phase should kickoff by establishing the purpose and objectives of the&#xD;
    potential implementation project. &amp;nbsp;This includes creating an understanding of the client’s current situation,&#xD;
    business environment, and the main pain points or areas of improvement, that have been identified. &amp;nbsp;Information&#xD;
    regarding current and future state is gathered in order to determine the scope of the Diagnostic phase and to identify&#xD;
    the appropriate skill sets and resources required for the Diagnostic activities.&lt;/span>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;span style=&quot;FONT-SIZE: 9pt&quot;>Typically the client and solutions account teams engage in a dialogue involving high-level&#xD;
    business process description and/or information related to the overall system landscape that the solution would replace&#xD;
    and/or integrate with. &amp;nbsp;This information might be made available in an RFI (Request for Information) or an RFP/RFQ&#xD;
    (Request for Proposal/Request for Quotation). &amp;nbsp;The information extracted from these and other documents&#xD;
    (including, the client’s web site, company organizational charts, and annual financial reports) can help the solution&#xD;
    account team to gain a good understanding of the client’s situation and business environment.&amp;nbsp; The goal of the&#xD;
    account team should be to build credibility with the client, giving them confidence that the team understands their&#xD;
    business, and ultimately in their proposal for the new solution.&lt;/span>&#xD;
