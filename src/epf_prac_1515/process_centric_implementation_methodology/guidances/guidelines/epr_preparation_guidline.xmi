    An Enterprise Process Review is often conducted over multiple days, and possibly even multiple weeks. Several people&#xD;
    representing a cross-section of the client's business are involved in the review sessions. As a result it can be very&#xD;
    challenging to even schedule the sessions. However, scheduling isn't the only challenge. In fact, it isn't even the&#xD;
    primary challenge. The primary challenge of an EPR is to get the necessary information from the client in the amount of&#xD;
    time allocated. We only get one attempt at a review session so it is imperative that we obtain the necessary&#xD;
    information from each session.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Proper preparation is essential to ensure the success of each session. This preparation starts with clearly&#xD;
    communicating proper expectaions and each party's roles and responsibilities.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It has been our experience that it works best to start by reviewing the statement of work and the initial in-scope&#xD;
    process list developed during the Discover phase. Based on this information a list of potential EPR sessions should be&#xD;
    compiled.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Next you shnould obtain a list of process stakeholders and subject matter experts from the client. Often they will not&#xD;
    have this readily available but will be able to produce it without much effort. You will want to get the names, titles&#xD;
    and roles for each person. This will be used to identify who shold be involved in each process review session.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Once you have a list of proposed review sessions and the list of process stakeholders then you can combine the two to&#xD;
    determine which stakeholders should attend which sessions.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    With this information you can produce a proposed EPR schedule for all the sessions. You may not be able to put dates on&#xD;
    the sessions because you do not have access the&amp;nbsp;calendars for the process stakeholders. But you can say who needs&#xD;
    to be in which sessions, how long each session should be and what sessions can be run in parallel.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This proposed EPR schedule should be sent to the client as part of the EPR communication packet. The other items in&#xD;
    that packet should be an explanation of the EPR process, an explanation of the client responsibilities and a request&#xD;
    for any existing process documentation.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    By providing this information to the client and then coordinating with the client after that to create a schedule with&#xD;
    dates and appropriate resources this will help prepare the client to fulfill their responsibillites in the EPR.&#xD;
